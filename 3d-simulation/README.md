# Adaptive LCD Windshield Simulation

## What is this?

This is an interactive demonstration of a new type of "smart windshield" technology that could make driving at night much safer. The simulation shows how a windshield with tiny LCD dots could automatically block the glare from oncoming headlights while still allowing you to see everything else clearly.

## The Problem This Solves

When you're driving at night and an oncoming car's headlights shine directly at you, it can temporarily blind you or make it hard to see the road. This is dangerous and uncomfortable. Current solutions like auto-dimming mirrors help with rearview glare, but not with headlights coming from the front.

## How This Technology Works

Imagine having a windshield with thousands of tiny dots that can turn dark individually, like pixels on a screen. This simulation shows how such a windshield could work:

1. A camera or sensor detects bright light sources (like oncoming headlights)
2. The system calculates exactly where that light would hit your eyes
3. Only the small area of the windshield where the glare passes through turns dark
4. The rest of the windshield stays completely clear
5. As the car moves, the darkened spots move dynamically to keep blocking the glare

## What You're Seeing in This Simulation

- **Yellow Spheres**: These represent headlights from oncoming vehicles
- **Blue Plane**: This is the windshield
- **Green Sphere**: This represents the driver's eyes
- **Black Circles**: These are the dynamic LCD shading elements that block the glare

## How to Run the Simulation

### Quick Start
1. Download this folder to your computer
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
3. That's it! The simulation should load automatically

### What if it doesn't work?
- Make sure you have a modern web browser (updated within the last year)
- Check that all files and folders are in their original locations
- If using a local file, some browsers may require you to enable JavaScript for local files

## How to Use the Interactive Demonstration

1. **First Look**: When you open the simulation, you'll see a 3D scene with a blue windshield, a green dot (your eyes), and a yellow dot (an oncoming headlight)
2. **Move Light Sources**: Click and drag any yellow sphere to move it around and see how the shading adjusts
3. **Add More Lights**: Click the "Add Light Source" button to add more headlights
4. **Remove Lights**: Click the "Delete Last Light Source" button to remove the most recently added light
5. **Navigate the Scene**: Click and drag to rotate the view, scroll to zoom in/out

## The Benefits

- Improves nighttime driving safety by reducing glare
- Maintains full visibility of the road and surroundings
- Works dynamically as cars move relative to each other
- Could potentially be implemented in future vehicle windshields

## Real-World Applications

This simulation is a simplified demonstration of technology that could eventually be integrated into real vehicles. Similar concepts are already being researched by automotive companies for next-generation vehicles. The actual implementation would be much more sophisticated, with:

- Thousands of tiny LCD elements instead of the few large ones shown here
- Advanced cameras and sensors to detect multiple light sources
- Real-time processing to handle highway speeds
- Integration with other driver assistance systems

This simulation demonstrates the concept in a simplified way. A real implementation would have many more, much smaller LCD elements and more sophisticated tracking of light sources.
